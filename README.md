# Internet_speed_checker_bot
A script with checks the internet speed you're getting and if the values are lower than the promised ones in your ISP's contract, a notepad is opened, generating a complaint message with all the values. It can be later used in a Twitter post to get the attention of your ISP. Since I don't have issues for now, I created the script only to show Selenium's potential. :)
